This simple script/app can be used by loading the index.html file in a browser window

It was a second foray into D3, focusing on histogram plotting vs line

Once the script is loaded, the user is presented with an input box and a "submit button".
Users can enter whatever text they please and on submit, a request will be made to the github API
which will return the first 30 usernames that match the input text.

The histogram displays a total count of each letter (and "other" char) in the 30 returned usernames.
The hisogram will update on each submission with new data and looks pretty cool, if I do say so myself
